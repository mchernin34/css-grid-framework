# css-grid-framework
Minimal CSS Grid Layout based framework.

## Available Classes

- `.container` - Wraps everything and sets the width contraints, adds a padding to the left and right and centers everything.
- `.row` - Acts as the grid wrapper.
- `.col-XX-YY` - The columns. Substitute **XX** with `xs`, `sm`, `md` and `lg` for extra small, small, medium and large viewports. Substitute **YY** with the number of columns that you would like the content to span on.
